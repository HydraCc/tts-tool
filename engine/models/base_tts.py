    Abstract base class for Text-to-Speech engines.
    
    This class defines the standard interface that all TTS implementations must follow.
    It provides a common structure for loading models, synthesizing speech, and saving audio.
    
    Attributes:
        config (Dict[str, Any]): Configuration dictionary containing engine-specific settings.
                                Default is an empty dictionary if none provided.
    
    Example:
        ```python
        class MyTTSEngine(BaseTTS):
            def load_model(self):
                # Implementation specific model loading

        Convert text to speech and return audio data as bytes.
        
        This is the core method that performs text-to-speech synthesis.

        Args:
            text (str): The input text to be converted to speech.
                       Should be preprocessed and ready for synthesis.
        
        Returns:
